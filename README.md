# Matrix and Vector Calculator ‚Äì ECE AUTH 2024-2025

This repository contains a C project developed for the "Structured Programming" course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), during the Winter Semester of the 2021-2022 academic year.

The project implements a **console-based calculator** that supports multiple operations on dynamically allocated vectors and matrices, including the ability to store/load them from binary files.
